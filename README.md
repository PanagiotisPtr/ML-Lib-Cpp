Simple implementations of Machine Learning Algorithms in C++


### GENERAL:

All the algorithms are implemented in C++ and are realtive simple. They of now they do not have any fancy variables but I am hoping that this will change.
This is a personal project. The main reason why I put it on github is that, if anyone is looking into how he can implement machine learning algorithms he can find out here. 

# The Code
The way that the code is structured is actually pretty simple.

All of the algorithms are implemented as classes in the MachineLearning namespace.
The Syntax of the classes is very similar to scikit learn.

### How to use the code. 
You can simply clone the repository and open the visual studio project file. 

If you do not want to use Visual Studio there only are 2 files that you have to care about. The MachineLearning.h which is the header file
for the classes and the MachineLearning.cpp which contains the functions.

Also I have setup an example at the main.cpp file so that you can experiment.

###### IMPORTANT
Classes that aren't yet been finished:

-> NeuralNetworkMLP class

I Hope that you find this repository helpful. Make sure to fork the repository is you like it.
